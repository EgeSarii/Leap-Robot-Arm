#### Week 4(26 September - 2 October) 
- Research and small implementation on Leap Motion is done.
- 6 DOF Makerfabs robot is ordered and started to assemble it.

#### Week 5(3 October - 9 October)
- 6 DOF Makerfabs robot is fully assembled
- Raspberry Pi Pico is installed and set up some example code is run and tested.
- Implementation on Leap Motion is started. The main goal is to find and implement hand gestures in leap motion corresponding to the commands for the robot arm.

#### Week 6(10 October - 16 October)
- Leap motion implementation is continued, a progress is achieved by defining some positions and gestures.
- PIO for Robot servos are created. Also some basic movements implemented for base servos.

#### Week 7(17 October - 23 October)
- Detecting movement and classifying it for the right hand  is implemented successfully in Leap Motion. The main challenge was to find which gesture was detected in Leap Motion.
- A grap and get movement implemented in Robot arm by using all the servos simultaneously. The arm goes for a specific location, get closes to the target, graps it and then take it to the destination and leaves there smoothly.
