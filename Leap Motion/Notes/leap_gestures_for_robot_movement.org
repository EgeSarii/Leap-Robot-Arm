This file contains the logic about the relation between gestures and
the movements of the robot.

A bit of terminology:

| GESTURES  | Those are the movements detected from the Leap Motion controller.                                             |
|           | These movements are based on hands, distances between hands and the amount of stretched fingers in each hand. |
|           | The captures gestures are used as input to move the robot.                                                    |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MOVEMENTS | Those are the actual movements of the robot arm.                                                              |
|           | Such movements are determined by the gestures captured by the Leap Motion Sensor.                             |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Because of the above, the key idea is to move the robot arm by the use
of the Leap motion sensor.
Because of this, it is required to map a gesture to the respective
movement.

The robot-arm uses servo motors to move a specific mechanical
component of itself. Servos move in the range [-90.0째, +90.0째].
There are 6 servos and hence 6 independent movements are possible.

The idea to map each servo, labeled from 1 to 6 to a movement.

This is done as follows:
